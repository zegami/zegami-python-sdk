# Zegami Python SDK
An SDK and general wrapper for the lower level Zegami API for Python. This package provides higher level collection interaction and data retrieval.

# Getting started
Grab this repo, open the script, and load an instance of ZegamiClient into a variable.

```
from zegami_sdk.client import ZegamiClient

zc = ZegamiClient(username, login)
```

## Credentials
The client operates using a user token. By default, logging in once with a valid username/password will save the acquired token to your home directory as
`zegami.token`. The next time you need to use ZegamiClient, you may call `zc = ZegamiClient()` with no arguments, and it will look for this stored token.


## Example Usage
### Get the metadata and images associated with every dog of the 'beagle' breed in a collection of dogs:

```
zc = ZegamiClient()
```

### Workspaces
To see your available workspaces, use:

```
zc.show_workspaces()
```

You can then ask for a workspace by name, by ID, or just from a list
```
all_workspaces = zc.workspaces
first_workspace = all_workspaces[0]
```

or:

```
zc.show_workspaces()

# Note the ID of a workspace
my_workspace = zc.get_workspace_by_id(id)
```


### Collections
```
my_workspace.show_collections()

# Note the name of a collection
coll = my_workspace.get_collection_by_name(name_of_collection)
```


You can get the metadata in a collection as a Pandas DataFrame using:

```
rows = coll.rows
```

You can get the images of a collection using:

```
first_10_img_urls = coll.get_image_urls(list(range(10)))
imgs = coll.download_image_batch(first_10_img_urls)
```

If your collection supports the new multi-image-source functionality, you can see your available sources using:

```
coll.show_sources()
```

For source 2's (3rd in 0-indexed-list) images, you would use:

```
first_10_source3_img_urls = novo_col.get_image_urls(list(range(10)), source=2)`

# To see the first of these:
coll.download_image(first_10_source3_img_urls[0])
```

### Using with onprem zegami

To use the client with an onprem installation of zegami you have to set the `home` keyword argument when instantiating `ZegamiClient`.

```
zegami_config = {
  'username': <user>,
  'password': <password>,
  'home': <url of onprem zegami>,
  'allow_save_token': True,
}

zc = ZegamiClient(**zegami_config)
```

If your onprem installation has self-signed certificates you can disable SSL verification using the environment variable `ALLOW_INSECURE_SSL` before running the python.

```
export ALLOW_INSECURE_SSL=true
python myscript.py
```
or
```
ALLOW_INSECURE_SSL=true python myscript.py
```
WARNING! You should not need to set this when using the SDK for cloud zegami

# In Development
This SDK is in active development, not all features are available yet. Creating/uploading to collections is not supported currently - check back soon!


# Developer Conventions
Keeping the SDK easy and fluent to use externally and internally is crucial. If contributing PRs, some things to consider:

## Relevant
MOST IMPORTANT - Zegami has concepts used internally in its data engine, like 'imageset', 'dataset'. Strive to never require the user to have to know anything about these, or even see them. If the user needs an image, they should ask for an image from a concept they ARE expected to understand like a 'collection' or a 'workspace'. Anything obscure should be hidden, for example: `_get_imageset()`, so that auto-suggestions of a class will always contain relevant and useful methods/attribs/properties.

## Obvious
Avoid ambiguous parameters. Use the best worded, lowest level parameters types for functions/methods. Give them obvious names. Any ambiguity or unobvious parameters MUST be described in detail in the docstring. Avoid parameters like 'target' or 'action', or describe them explicitly. If an instance is needed, describe how/where that instance should come from.

## `assert`
If you expect an RGB image, check that your input is an array, that its len(shape) == 3, that shape[2] == 3. Use a proper message if this is not the case.

## Minimal
Do not ask for more information than is already obtainable. A source knows its parent collection, which knows how to get its own IDs and knows the client. A method never needs to reference a source, the owning collection, and the client all together. Moreover, these chains should have sensible assertions and checks built in, and potentially property/method-based shortcuts (with assertions).

## Helpful
Use sensible defaults wherever possible for minimal effort when using the SDK. V1 collections typically use `source=None`, while V2 collections use `source=0`. This allows a user with an old/new (single source) collection to never even have to know what a source is when fetching images.
